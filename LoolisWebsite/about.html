            <h2>To Looli,</h2>
            <p>Looli is the woman that puts a smile on everyones face, lights up every room she walks into, and gives off so much positive energy to herself and the people around her,
                Looli has jaw dropping beauty, more than anyone can ever comprehend before their own eyes. She glows, she shocks, and flatters everyone she walks past with her goddess-like beauty.
                Although, you cannot be fooled. Despite her great humor, jaw dropping beauty, and glowing personality. She is intelligent. She has a solution for every problem,
            outperforms on her studies and always on top of that. She is what I describe, the perfect woman. Inside and out. The best as it comes. Nothing is like her, and nothing will ever BE like her.
        She is the one, the greatest, and deserves the world.<p>

        </p>I love you Looli,</p>
            </p>Antwon</p>
